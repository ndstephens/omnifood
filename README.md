## Learning Project

This fake site was built while taking an online course for the purpose of
learning and practicing some HTML and CSS.

It could still use several improvements, primarily with its responsiveness. But
for now I'm moving onto other projects.

It also shows very poorly and is broken when viewed on github pages. Would need
to work out all the kinks. Views fine on a local server. Oh well...
